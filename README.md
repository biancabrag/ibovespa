Time Series Forecasting using Prophet and Deep Learning on Python.
This project starts with an EDA, then a pre-analysis to check and see if we could opt for traditional forecasting models.
Then, we use the 'Prophet' library, ending with a Deep Learning Model to check for the best accuracy possible.
